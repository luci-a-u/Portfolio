    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to express my interest in the position of <span class="highlight">Security Analyst Intern</span> or <span class="highlight">Junior Penetration Tester</span> at your esteemed organization. As a passionate and self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast with real-world bug bounty experience on platforms like HackerOne, I bring practical skills and a deep curiosity for ethical hacking and vulnerability analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since completing my Class 12 with Science, Math, and Computer Science in 2024, I have dedicated myself full-time to strengthening my knowledge in cybersecurity. I have hands-on experience with tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap, Nikto, and Gobuster, and have successfully identified vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and Remote Code Execution in live environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to bug hunting, I have developed scripting skills in Python and Bash to automate security tasks, and I possess a solid understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and their mitigation strategies. I also regularly engage with platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox to refine my technical abilities and stay updated on the latest security trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though I am yet to gain formal job experience, my proactive learning, practical exposure, and strong problem-solving mindset equip me to contribute effectively to a cybersecurity team. I am eager to join a professional environment where I can learn from experienced mentors, add value to your security initiatives, and grow with your organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.
    </p>
